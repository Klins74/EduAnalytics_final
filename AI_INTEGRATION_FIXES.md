# AI Integration Fixes

## Issues and Solutions

### 1. API Service Not Running

**Problem:** The API service was not running, causing "Failed to fetch" errors in the frontend.

**Solution:** Started the API service with `docker compose up -d api`.

### 2. Ollama Memory Issues

**Problem:** The llama3.1 model was too large for the available memory in the Docker container:

```
model request too large for system - requested: 5.6 GiB, available: 3.6 GiB
```

**Solution:** 
1. Pulled a smaller model (tinyllama) that fits in the available memory:
   ```
   docker exec -it eduanalytics_ollama ollama pull tinyllama
   ```

2. Updated the configuration to use the smaller model:
   - Updated `docker-compose.yml` to use tinyllama as the default model
   - Updated `server/app/core/config.py` to use tinyllama as the default model

3. Modified the AI service to explicitly use the tinyllama model:
   - Updated `server/app/services/ai_service.py` to force using tinyllama model
   - Added better error handling for API calls to Ollama
   - Added status code checking for streaming responses

### 3. Encoding Issues

**Problem:** The API responses had encoding issues, showing garbled text in the frontend.

**Solution:** Fixed the encoding issues by ensuring proper error handling and response formatting in the AI service.

## Testing

1. Verified that the API service is running correctly
2. Confirmed that the tinyllama model works with the Ollama service
3. Tested the AI analytics page to ensure it can communicate with the API
4. Verified that the responses are properly formatted and displayed

## Future Recommendations

1. **Memory Management:** Consider increasing the memory allocation for the Ollama container if larger models are needed
2. **Error Handling:** Implement more robust error handling in the frontend to display meaningful error messages
3. **Fallback Mechanism:** Add a fallback mechanism to use a different AI provider if Ollama is not available
4. **Model Selection:** Add a UI option to select different models based on the use case
5. **Caching:** Implement caching for common AI responses to reduce load on the Ollama service
